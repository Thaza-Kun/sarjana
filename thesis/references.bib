	abstract     = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-time-scale bursts of coherent radio emission that are luminous enough to be detectable at cosmological distances. In this Review, I describe the discovery of FRBs, subsequent advances in understanding them, and future prospects. Thousands of potentially observable FRBs reach Earth every day, which likely originate from highly magnetic and/or rapidly rotating neutron stars in the distant Universe. Some FRBs repeat, with this subclass often occurring in highly magnetic environments. Two repeating FRBs exhibit cyclic activity windows, consistent with an orbital period. One nearby FRB was emitted by a Galactic magnetar during an x-ray outburst. The host galaxies of some FRBs have been located, providing information about the host environments and the total baryonic content of the Universe.},

	abstract     = {Abstract                            We present a catalog of 536 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) Project between 400 and 800 MHz from 2018 July 25 to 2019 July 1, including 62 bursts from 18 previously reported repeating sources. The catalog represents the first large sample, including bursts from repeaters and nonrepeaters, observed in a single survey with uniform selection effects. This facilitates comparative and absolute studies of the FRB population. We show that repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters have sky locations and dispersion measures (DMs) that are consistent with being drawn from the same distribution. However, bursts from repeating sources differ from apparent nonrepeaters in intrinsic temporal width and spectral bandwidth. Through injection of simulated events into our detection pipeline, we perform an absolute calibration of selection effects to account for systematic biases. We find evidence for a population of FRBs\textemdash composing a large fraction of the overall population\textemdash with a scattering time at 600 MHz in excess of 10 ms, of which only a small fraction are observed by CHIME/FRB. We infer a power-law index for the cumulative fluence distribution of                                                                                                        {$\alpha$}                   =                   -                   1.40                   {$\pm$}                   0.11                   (                   stat.                                                               )                                                                 -                       0.09                                                                 +                       0.06                                                           (                   sys.                   )                                                                , consistent with the -3/2 expectation for a nonevolving population in Euclidean space.
