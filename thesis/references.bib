In this Review, I describe the discovery of FRBs, subsequent advances in understanding them, and future prospects. Thousands of potentially observable FRBs reach Earth every day, which likely originate from highly magnetic and/or rapidly rotating neutron stars in the distant Universe. Some FRBs repeat, with this subclass often occurring in highly magnetic environments. Two repeating FRBs exhibit cyclic activity windows, consistent with an orbital period. One nearby FRB was emitted by a Galactic magnetar during an x-ray outburst. The host galaxies of some FRBs have been located, providing information about the host environments and the total baryonic content of the Universe.},

	abstract     = {The origins of fast radio bursts (FRBs), astronomical transients with millisecond time-scales, remain unknown. One of the difficulties stems from the possibility that observed FRBs could be heterogeneous in origin; as some of them have been observed to repeat, and others have not. Due to limited observing periods and telescope sensitivities, some bursts may be misclassified as non-repeaters. Therefore, it is important to clearly distinguish FRBs into repeaters and non-repeaters, to better understand their origins. In this work, we classify repeaters and non-repeaters using unsupervised machine learning, without relying on expensive monitoring observations. We present a repeating FRB recognition method based on the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). The main goals of this work are to: (i) show that the unsupervised UMAP can classify repeating FRB population without any prior knowledge about their repetition, (ii) evaluate the assumption that non-repeating FRBs are contaminated by repeating FRBs, and (iii) recognize the FRB repeater candidates without monitoring observations and release a corresponding catalogue. We apply our method to the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) data base. We found that the unsupervised UMAP classification provides a repeating FRB completeness of 95 per cent and identifies 188 FRB repeater source candidates from 474 non-repeater sources. This work paves the way to a new classification of repeaters and non-repeaters based on a single epoch observation of FRBs.},

While repeating FRBs cannot be classified into the non-repeating group, it is unknown whether the apparently non-repeating FRBs are actually repeating FRBs whose repetitions are yet to be discovered, or whether they belong to another physically distinct type from the repeating ones. In a series of two papers, we attempt to disentangle this mystery with machine learning methods. In this first paper, we focus on an array of supervised machine learning methods. We train the machine learning algorithms with a fraction of the observed FRBs in the first CHIME/FRB catalog, telling them which ones are apparently non-repeating and which ones are repeating. We then let the trained models predict the repetitiveness of the rest of the FRB data with the observed parameters, and we compare the predictions with the observed repetitiveness. We find that the models can predict most FRBs correctly, hinting towards distinct mechanisms behind repeating and non-repeating FRBs. We also find that the two most important distinguishing factors between non-repeating and repeating FRBs are brightness temperature and rest-frame frequency bandwidth. By applying the trained models back to the entire first CHIME catalog, we further identify some potentially repeating FRBs currently reported as non-repeating. We recommend a list of these bursts as targets for future observing campaigns to search for repeated bursts in a combination with the results presented in Paper II using unsupervised machine learning methods.},

In our 2019 review on the subject, we presented a growing, but still mysterious, population of FRBs\textemdash 60 unique sources, 2 repeating FRBs, and only 1 identified host galaxy. However, in only a few short years, new observations and discoveries have given us a wealth of information about these sources. The total FRB population now stands at over 600 published sources, 24 repeaters, and 19 host galaxies. Higher time resolution data, sustained monitoring, and precision localisations have given us insight into repeaters, host galaxies, burst morphology, source activity, progenitor models, and the use of FRBs as cosmological probes. The recent detection of a bright FRB-like burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935 ? 2154 provides an important link between FRBs and magnetars. There also continue to be surprising discoveries, like periodic modulation of activity from repeaters and the localisation of one FRB source to a relatively nearby globular cluster associated with the M81 galaxy. In this review, we summarise the exciting observational results from the past few years. We also highlight their impact on our understanding of the FRB population and proposed progenitor models. We build on the introduction to FRBs in our earlier review, update our readers on recent results, and discuss interesting avenues for exploration as the field enters a new regime where hundreds to thousands of new FRBs will be discovered and reported each year.},

The catalog consists of 62 bursts from 18 repeating sources, plus 474 one-off FRBs, detected between 2018 July 25 and 2019 July 2. We identify four observed archetypes of burst morphology (``simple broadband,'' ``simple narrowband,'' ``temporally complex,'' and ``downward drifting'') and describe relevant instrumental biases that are essential for interpreting the observed morphologies. Using the catalog properties of the FRBs, we confirm that bursts from repeating sources, on average, have larger widths, and we show, for the first time, that bursts from repeating sources, on average, are narrower in bandwidth. This difference could be due to beaming or propagation effects, or it could be intrinsic to the populations. We discuss potential implications of these morphological differences for using FRBs as astrophysical tools.},

	abstract     = {Low frequency radio waves, while challenging to observe, are a rich source of information about pulsars. The LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) is a new radio interferometer operating in the lowest 4 octaves of the ionospheric ``radio window'': 10\textendash 240 MHz, that will greatly facilitate observing pulsars at low radio frequencies. Through the huge collecting area, long baselines, and flexible digital hardware, it is expected that LOFAR will revolutionize radio astronomy at the lowest frequencies visible from Earth. LOFAR is a next-generation radio telescope and a pathfinder to the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), in that it incorporates advanced multi-beaming techniques between thousands of individual elements. We discuss the motivation for low-frequency pulsar observations in general and the potential of LOFAR in addressing these science goals. We present LOFAR as it is designed to perform high-time-resolution observations of pulsars and other fast transients, and outline the various relevant observing modes and data reduction pipelines that are already or will soon be implemented to facilitate these observations. A number of results obtained from commissioning observations are presented to demonstrate the exciting potential of the telescope. This paper outlines the case for low frequency pulsar observations and is also intended to serve as a reference for upcoming pulsar/fast transient science papers with LOFAR.},

	abstract     = {Abstract                            We present a catalog of 536 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) Project between 400 and 800 MHz from 2018 July 25 to 2019 July 1, including 62 bursts from 18 previously reported repeating sources. The catalog represents the first large sample, including bursts from repeaters and nonrepeaters, observed in a single survey with uniform selection effects. This facilitates comparative and absolute studies of the FRB population. We show that repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters have sky locations and dispersion measures (DMs) that are consistent with being drawn from the same distribution. However, bursts from repeating sources differ from apparent nonrepeaters in intrinsic temporal width and spectral bandwidth. Through injection of simulated events into our detection pipeline, we perform an absolute calibration of selection effects to account for systematic biases. We find evidence for a population of FRBs\textemdash composing a large fraction of the overall population\textemdash with a scattering time at 600 MHz in excess of 10 ms, of which only a small fraction are observed by CHIME/FRB. We infer a power-law index for the cumulative fluence distribution of                                                                                                        {$\alpha$}                   =                   -                   1.40                   {$\pm$}                   0.11                   (                   stat.                                                               )                                                                 -                       0.09                                                                 +                       0.06                                                           (                   sys.                   )                                                                , consistent with the -3/2 expectation for a nonevolving population in Euclidean space.

However, due to the lack of continuous observations, some apparently repeaters may have been incorrectly recognized as non-repeaters. In a series of two papers, we intend to solve such problem with machine learning. In this second paper of the series, we focus on an array of unsupervised machine learning methods. We apply multiple unsupervised machine learning algorithms to the first CHIME/FRB catalog to learn their features and classify FRBs into different clusters without any premise about the FRBs being repeaters or non-repeaters. These clusters reveal the differences between repeaters and non-repeaters. Then, by comparing with the identities of the FRBs in the observed classes, we evaluate the performance of various algorithms and analyze the physical meaning behind the results. Finally, we recommend a list of most credible repeater candidates as targets for future observing campaigns to search for repeated bursts in combination of the results presented in Paper I using supervised machine learning methods.},
