	abstract     = {We compare the dispersion measure (DM) statistics of FRBs detected by the ASKAP and Parkes radio telescopes. We jointly model their DM distributions, exploiting the fact that the telescopes have different survey fluence limits but likely sample the same underlying population. After accounting for the effects of instrumental temporal and spectral resolution of each sample, we find that a fit between the modelled and observed DM distribution, using identical population parameters, provides a good fit to both distributions. Assuming a one-to-one mapping between DM and redshift for an homogeneous intergalactic medium (IGM), we determine the best-fitting parameters of the population spectral index, \$\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash alpha \}\$, and the power-law index of the burst energy distribution, \$\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash gamma \}\$, for different redshift evolutionary models. Whilst the overall best-fitting model yields \$\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash alpha \}=2.2\_\{-1.0\}\^\{+0.7\}\$ and \$\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash gamma \}=2.0\_\{-0.1\}\^\{+0.3\}\$, for a strong redshift evolutionary model, when we admit the further constraint of {$\alpha$} = 1.5 we favour the best fit \$\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash gamma \}=1.5 \textbackslash pm 0.2\$ and the case of no redshift evolution. Moreover, we find no evidence that the FRB population evolves faster than linearly with respect to the star formation rate over the DM (redshift) range for the sampled population.},

Thousands of potentially observable FRBs reach Earth every day, which likely originate from highly magnetic and/or rapidly rotating neutron stars in the distant Universe. Some FRBs repeat, with this subclass often occurring in highly magnetic environments. Two repeating FRBs exhibit cyclic activity windows, consistent with an orbital period. One nearby FRB was emitted by a Galactic magnetar during an x-ray outburst.

	abstract     = {The origins of fast radio bursts (FRBs), astronomical transients with millisecond time-scales, remain unknown. One of the difficulties stems from the possibility that observed FRBs could be heterogeneous in origin; as some of them have been observed to repeat, and others have not. Due to limited observing periods and telescope sensitivities, some bursts may be misclassified as non-repeaters. Therefore, it is important to clearly distinguish FRBs into repeaters and non-repeaters, to better understand their origins. In this work, we classify repeaters and non-repeaters using unsupervised machine learning, without relying on expensive monitoring observations. We present a repeating FRB recognition method based on the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). The main goals of this work are to: (i) show that the unsupervised UMAP can classify repeating FRB population without any prior knowledge about their repetition, (ii) evaluate the assumption that non-repeating FRBs are contaminated by repeating FRBs, and (iii) recognize the FRB repeater candidates without monitoring observations and release a corresponding catalogue. We apply our method to the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) data base. We found that the unsupervised UMAP classification provides a repeating FRB completeness of 95 per cent and identifies 188 FRB repeater source candidates from 474 non-repeater sources. This work paves the way to a new classification of repeaters and non-repeaters based on a single epoch observation of FRBs.},

One striking difference between repeaters and apparent non-repeaters in the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment sample is that the once-off events are typically shorter in duration than sources that have been detected two or more times. We offer a simple explanation for this discrepancy based on a selection effect due to beamed emission, in which highly beamed FRBs are less easily observed to repeat, but are abundant enough to detect often as once-off events. The explanation predicts that there is a continuous distribution of burst duration \textendash{} not a static bimodal one \textendash{} with a correlation between repetition rate and width. Pulse width and opening angle may be related by relativistic effects in shocks, where short-duration bursts have small solid angles due to a large common Lorentz factor. Alternatively, the relationship could be a geometric effect where narrow beams sweep past the observer more quickly, as with pulsars. Our model has implications for the FRB emission mechanism and energy scale, volumetric event rates, and the application of FRBs to cosmology.},

This work builds upon and supercedes the Taylor \& Cordes (1993) model by exploiting new observations and analysis methods. For lines of sight directed out of the Galactic plane, the new model yields substantially larger values for pulsar dispersion measures, except for directions dominated by the local hot bubble. Unlike the TC93 model, the new model provides sufficient electrons to account for the dispersion measures of the vast majority of known, Galactic pulsars. The new model is described and exemplified using plots of astronomically useful quantities on Galactic-coordinate grids. Software available on the Internet is also described. Future observations and analysis techniques that will improve the Galactic model are outlined.},

In this paper, we analyzed 18 repeaters and 12 non-repeating FRBs observed in the frequency bands of 400\textendash 800 MHz from Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). We investigated the distributions of FRB isotropic-equivalent radio luminosity, considering the K correction. Statistically, the luminosity distribution can be better fitted by Gaussian form than by power-law. Based on the above results, together with the observed FRB event rate, pulse duration, and radio luminosity, FRB origin models are evaluated and constrained such that the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may be excluded for the non-repeaters while magnetars or neutron stars (NSs) emitting the supergiant pulses are preferred for the repeaters. We also found the necessity of a small FRB emission beaming solid angle (about 0.1 sr) from magnetars that should be considered, and/or the FRB association with soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) may lie at a low probability of about 10\%. Finally, we discussed the uncertainty of FRB luminosity caused by the estimation of the distance that is inferred by the simple relation between the redshift and dispersion measure (DM).},

	abstract     = {Although fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been an active field in astronomy and cosmology, their origin is still unknown to date. One of the interesting topics is the classification of FRBs, which is closely related to the origin of FRBs. Different physical mechanisms are required by different classes of FRBs. In the literature, they usually could be classified into non-repeating and repeating FRBs. Well motivated by the observations, here we are interested in the possible subclassification of FRBs. By using the first CHIME/FRB catalog, we propose to subclassify non-repeating (type I) FRBs into type Ia and Ib FRBs. The distribution of type Ia FRBs is delayed with respect to the cosmic star formation history (SFH), and hence they are probably associated with old stellar populations, while the distribution of type Ib FRBs tracks SFH, and hence they are probably associated with young stellar populations. Accordingly, the physical criteria for this subclassification of type I FRBs have been clearly determined. We find that there are some tight empirical correlations for type Ia FRBs but not for type Ib FRBs, and vice versa. These make them different in physical properties. Similarly, we suggest that repeating (type II) FRBs could also be subclassified into type IIa and IIb FRBs. A universal subclassification scheme is given at the end.

	abstract     = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious millisecond pulses in radio, most of which originate from distant galaxies. Revealing the origin of FRBs is becoming central in astronomy. The redshift evolution of the FRB energy function, i.e. the number density of FRB sources as a function of energy, provides important implications for the FRB progenitors. Here, we show the energy functions of FRBs selected from the recently released Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) catalogue using the Vmax method. The Vmax method allows us to measure the redshift evolution of the energy functions as it is without any prior assumption on the evolution. We use a homogeneous sample of 164 non-repeating FRB sources, which are about one order of magnitude larger than previously investigated samples. The energy functions of non-repeating FRBs show Schechter function-like shapes at z {$\lessequivlnt$} 1. The energy functions and volumetric rates of non-repeating FRBs decrease towards higher redshifts similar to the cosmic stellar-mass density evolution: there is no significant difference between the non-repeating FRB rate and cosmic stellar-mass density evolution with a 1~per~cent significance threshold, whereas the cosmic star-formation rate scenario is rejected with a more than 99~per~cent confidence level. Our results indicate that the event rate of non-repeating FRBs is likely controlled by old populations rather than young populations that are traced by the cosmic star-formation rate density. This suggests old populations, such as old neutron stars and black holes, as more likely progenitors of non-repeating FRBs.},

Especially, to constrain the time variability of the dark energy, a new, standardizable candle that can reach more distant Universe has been awaited. Here we propose a new distance measure using fast radio bursts (FRBs), which are a new emerging population of {$\sim$} ms time-scale radio bursts that can reach high-z in quantity. We show an empirical positive correlation between the time-integrated luminosity (L{$\nu$}) and rest-frame intrinsic duration (wint, rest) of FRBs. The L{$\nu-$}wint, rest correlation is with a weak strength but statistically very significant, i.e. Pearson coefficient is {$\sim$} 0.5 with P value of {$\sim$}0.038, despite the smallness of the current sample. This correlation can be used to measure intrinsic luminosity of FRBs from the observed wint, rest. By comparing the luminosity with observed flux, we measure luminosity distances to FRBs, and thereby construct the Hubble diagram. This FRB cosmology with the L{$\nu-$}wint, rest relation has several advantages over SNe Ia, Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB), and well-known FRB dispersion measure (DM)-z cosmology; (i) access to higher redshift Universe beyond the SNe Ia, (ii) high event rate that is {$\sim$}3 orders of magnitude more frequent than GRBs, and (iii) it is free from the uncertainty from intergalactic electron density models, i.e. we can remove the largest uncertainty in the well-debated DM-z cosmology of FRB. Our simulation suggests that the L{$\nu-$}wint, rest relation provides us with useful constraints on the time variability of the dark energy when the next-generation radio telescopes start to find FRBs in quantity.},

The time-integrated-luminosity functions of non-repeating FRBs do not show any significant redshift evolution. The volumetric occurrence rates are almost constant during the past {$\sim$}10\,Gyr. The nearly-constant rate is consistent with a flat trend of cosmic stellar-mass density traced by old stellar populations. Our findings indicate that the occurrence rate of non-repeating FRBs follows the stellar-mass evolution of long-living objects with {$\sim$}Gyr time-scales, favouring e.g. white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes, as likely progenitors of non-repeating FRBs. In contrast, the occurrence rates of repeating FRBs may increase towards higher redshifts in a similar way to the cosmic star formation rate density or black hole accretion rate density if the slope of their luminosity function does not evolve with redshift. Short-living objects with {$\lessequivlnt$}Myr time-scales associated with young stellar populations (or their remnants, e.g. supernova remnants, young pulsars, and magnetars) or active galactic nuclei might be favoured as progenitor candidates of repeating FRBs.},

While repeating FRBs cannot be classified into the non-repeating group, it is unknown whether the apparently non-repeating FRBs are actually repeating FRBs whose repetitions are yet to be discovered, or whether they belong to another physically distinct type from the repeating ones. In a series of two papers, we attempt to disentangle this mystery with machine learning methods. In this first paper, we focus on an array of supervised machine learning methods. We train the machine learning algorithms with a fraction of the observed FRBs in the first CHIME/FRB catalog, telling them which ones are apparently non-repeating and which ones are repeating. We then let the trained models predict the repetitiveness of the rest of the FRB data with the observed parameters, and we compare the predictions with the observed repetitiveness. We find that the models can predict most FRBs correctly, hinting towards distinct mechanisms behind repeating and non-repeating FRBs. We also find that the two most important distinguishing factors between non-repeating and repeating FRBs are brightness temperature and rest-frame frequency bandwidth. By applying the trained models back to the entire first CHIME catalog, we further identify some potentially repeating FRBs currently reported as non-repeating. We recommend a list of these bursts as targets for future observing campaigns to search for repeated bursts in a combination with the results presented in Paper II using unsupervised machine learning methods.},

We analyse the flux density and fluence distributions of FRBs as a tool to investigate their luminosity distance distribution and the evolution of their prevalence throughout cosmic history. We examine in detail particular scenarios in which the burst population follows some power of the cosmic star formation rate. FRBs present an important additional measurable over source counts of existing cosmological populations, namely the dispersion measure. Based on the known redshift of FRB121102 (the repeater) we expect at least 50\,per\,cent of the dispersion measure to be attributable to the intergalactic medium and hence it can be used as a proxy for distance. We develop the framework to interpret the dispersion measure distribution, and investigate how the effect of Helium reionization in the intergalactic medium is evident in this distribution. Examination of existing data suggests that the FRB luminosity function is flatter than a critical slope, making FRBs easily detectable to large distances; in this regime the reduction in flux density with distance is outweighed by the increase in the number of bright bursts within the search volume.},

In our 2019 review on the subject, we presented a growing, but still mysterious, population of FRBs\textemdash 60 unique sources, 2 repeating FRBs, and only 1 identified host galaxy. However, in only a few short years, new observations and discoveries have given us a wealth of information about these sources. The total FRB population now stands at over 600 published sources, 24 repeaters, and 19 host galaxies. Higher time resolution data, sustained monitoring, and precision localisations have given us insight into repeaters, host galaxies, burst morphology, source activity, progenitor models, and the use of FRBs as cosmological probes. The recent detection of a bright FRB-like burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935 ? 2154 provides an important link between FRBs and magnetars. There also continue to be surprising discoveries, like periodic modulation of activity from repeaters and the localisation of one FRB source to a relatively nearby globular cluster associated with the M81 galaxy. In this review, we summarise the exciting observational results from the past few years. We also highlight their impact on our understanding of the FRB population and proposed progenitor models. We build on the introduction to FRBs in our earlier review, update our readers on recent results, and discuss interesting avenues for exploration as the field enters a new regime where hundreds to thousands of new FRBs will be discovered and reported each year.},

The catalog consists of 62 bursts from 18 repeating sources, plus 474 one-off FRBs, detected between 2018 July 25 and 2019 July 2. We identify four observed archetypes of burst morphology (``simple broadband,'' ``simple narrowband,'' ``temporally complex,'' and ``downward drifting'') and describe relevant instrumental biases that are essential for interpreting the observed morphologies. Using the catalog properties of the FRBs, we confirm that bursts from repeating sources, on average, have larger widths, and we show, for the first time, that bursts from repeating sources, on average, are narrower in bandwidth. This difference could be due to beaming or propagation effects, or it could be intrinsic to the populations. We discuss potential implications of these morphological differences for using FRBs as astrophysical tools.},

In this manuscript, we examine the signatures of gas in dark matter haloes (aka halo gas) on DM observations in current and forthcoming FRB surveys. Combining constraints from observations of the high-velocity clouds, O\,vii absorption, and the DM to the Large Magellanic Cloud with hydrostatic models of halo gas, we estimate that our Galactic halo will contribute \$\{\textbackslash rm DM\_\{\textbackslash rm MW,halo\}\}\textbackslash approx 50\textbackslash hbox\{--\}80 \{\textbackslash rm \textbackslash,pc \textbackslash, cm\^\{-3\}\}\$ from the Sun to 200\,kpc independent of any contribution from the Galactic ISM. Extending analysis to the Local Group, we demonstrate that M31's halo will be easily detected by high-sample FRB surveys (e.g. CHIME) although signatures from a putative Local Group medium may compete. We then review current empirical constraints on halo gas in distant galaxies and discuss the implications for their DM contributions. We further examine the DM probability distribution function of a population of FRBs at \$z\$ {$\gg$} 0 using an updated halo mass function and new models for the halo density profile. Lastly, we illustrate the potential of FRB experiments for resolving the baryonic fraction of haloes by analysing simulated sightlines through the CASBaH survey. All of the codes and data products of our analysis are available at https://github.com/FRBs.},

	abstract     = {Currently, fast radio bursts (FRBs) have become a very active field in astronomy and cosmology. However, the origin of FRBs is still unknown to date. The studies on the intrinsic FRB distributions might help us to reveal the possible origins of FRBs, and improve the simulations for FRB cosmology. Recently, the first CHIME/FRB catalog of 536 events was released. Such a large uniform sample of FRBs detected by a single telescope is very valuable to test the FRB distributions. Later, it has been claimed that the FRB distribution model tracking the cosmic star formation history (SFH) was rejected by the first CHIME/FRB catalog. In the present work, we consider some empirical FRB distribution models, and find that many of them can be fully consistent with the CHIME/FRB observational data for some suitable model parameters. Notice that a suppressed evolution with respect to SFH is commonly found for FRBs. In particular, we independently confirm that the FRB distribution model tracking SFH can be rejected at very high confidence. On the other hand, all the ``successful'' models effectively require a certain degree of ``delay'' with respect to SFH. These results might shed light on the origin of FRBs and FRB cosmology.},

	abstract     = {Despite considerable efforts over the past decade, only 34 fast radio bursts\textemdash intense bursts of radio emission from beyond our Galaxy\textemdash have been reported1,2. Attempts to understand the population as a whole have been hindered by the highly heterogeneous nature of the searches, which have been conducted with telescopes of different sensitivities, at a range of radio frequencies, and in environments corrupted by different levels of radio-frequency interference from human activity. Searches have been further complicated by uncertain burst positions and brightnesses\textemdash a consequence of the transient nature of the sources and the poor angular resolution of the detecting instruments. The discovery of repeating bursts from one source3, and its subsequent localization4 to a dwarf galaxy at a distance of 3.7 billion light years, confirmed that the population of fast radio bursts is located at cosmological distances. However, the nature of the emission remains elusive. Here we report a well controlled, wide-field radio survey for these bursts. We found 20, none of which repeated during follow-up observations between 185\textendash 1,097~hours after the initial detections. The sample includes both the nearest and the most energetic bursts detected so far. The survey demonstrates that there is a relationship between burst dispersion~and brightness and that~the high-fluence bursts are the nearby analogues of the more distant events found in higher-sensitivity, narrower-field surveys5.},

	abstract     = {Recent work has exploited pulsar survey data to identify temporally isolated, millisecond-duration radio bursts with large dispersion measures (DMs). These bursts have been interpreted as arising from a population of extragalactic sources, in which case they would provide unprecedented opportunities for probing the intergalactic medium; they may also be linked to new source classes. Until now, however, all so-called fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been detected with the Parkes radio telescope and its 13-beam receiver, casting some concern about the astrophysical nature of these signals. Here we present FRB 121102, the first FRB discovery from a geographic location other than Parkes. FRB 121102 was found in the Galactic anti-center region in the 1.4 GHz Pulsar Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) survey with the Arecibo Observatory with a DM = 557.4 {$\pm$} 2.0 pc cm-3, pulse width of 3.0 {$\pm$} 0.5 ms, and no evidence of interstellar scattering. The observed delay of the signal arrival time with frequency agrees precisely with the expectation of dispersion through an ionized medium. Despite its low Galactic latitude (b = -0.\textdegree 2), the burst has three times the maximum Galactic DM expected along this particular line of sight, suggesting an extragalactic origin. A peculiar aspect of the signal is an inverted spectrum; we interpret this as a consequence of being detected in a sidelobe of the ALFA receiver. FRB 121102's brightness, duration, and the inferred event rate are all consistent with the properties of the previously detected Parkes bursts.},

The LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) is a new radio interferometer operating in the lowest 4 octaves of the ionospheric ``radio window'': 10\textendash 240 MHz, that will greatly facilitate observing pulsars at low radio frequencies. Through the huge collecting area, long baselines, and flexible digital hardware, it is expected that LOFAR will revolutionize radio astronomy at the lowest frequencies visible from Earth. LOFAR is a next-generation radio telescope and a pathfinder to the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), in that it incorporates advanced multi-beaming techniques between thousands of individual elements. We discuss the motivation for low-frequency pulsar observations in general and the potential of LOFAR in addressing these science goals. We present LOFAR as it is designed to perform high-time-resolution observations of pulsars and other fast transients, and outline the various relevant observing modes and data reduction pipelines that are already or will soon be implemented to facilitate these observations. A number of results obtained from commissioning observations are presented to demonstrate the exciting potential of the telescope. This paper outlines the case for low frequency pulsar observations and is also intended to serve as a reference for upcoming pulsar/fast transient science papers with LOFAR.},

	abstract     = {Abstract                            We present a catalog of 536 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) Project between 400 and 800 MHz from 2018 July 25 to 2019 July 1, including 62 bursts from 18 previously reported repeating sources. The catalog represents the first large sample, including bursts from repeaters and nonrepeaters, observed in a single survey with uniform selection effects. This facilitates comparative and absolute studies of the FRB population. We show that repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters have sky locations and dispersion measures (DMs) that are consistent with being drawn from the same distribution. However, bursts from repeating sources differ from apparent nonrepeaters in intrinsic temporal width and spectral bandwidth. Through injection of simulated events into our detection pipeline, we perform an absolute calibration of selection effects to account for systematic biases. We find evidence for a population of FRBs\textemdash composing a large fraction of the overall population\textemdash with a scattering time at 600 MHz in excess of 10 ms, of which only a small fraction are observed by CHIME/FRB. We infer a power-law index for the cumulative fluence distribution of                                                                                                        {$\alpha$}                   =                   -                   1.40                   {$\pm$}                   0.11                   (                   stat.                                                               )                                                                 -                       0.09                                                                 +                       0.06                                                           (                   sys.                   )                                                                , consistent with the -3/2 expectation for a nonevolving population in Euclidean space. We find that               {$\alpha$}               is steeper for high-DM events and shallower for low-DM events, which is what would be expected when DM is correlated with distance.

The Galactic model has an extended thick disk representing the so-called warm interstellar medium, a thin disk representing the Galactic molecular ring, spiral arms based on a recent fit to Galactic H II regions, a Galactic Center disk, and seven local features including the Gum Nebula, Galactic Loop I, and the Local Bubble. An offset of the Sun from the Galactic plane and a warp of the outer Galactic disk are included in the model. Parameters of the Galactic model are determined by fitting to 189 pulsars with independently determined distances and DMs. Simple models are used for the Magellanic Clouds and the IGM. Galactic model distances are within the uncertainty range for 86 of the 189 independently determined distances and within 20\% of the nearest limit for a further 38 pulsars. We estimate that 95\% of predicted Galactic pulsar distances will have a relative error of less than a factor of 0.9. The predictions of YMW16 are compared to those of the TC93 and NE2001 models showing that YMW16 performs significantly better on all measures. Timescales for pulse broadening due to interstellar scattering are estimated for (real or simulated) Galactic and Magellanic Cloud pulsars and FRBs.},

The association of the Galactic FRB 200428 with the young magnetar SGR 1935+2154 raises the working hypothesis that FRB sources track the star formation history of the universe. The discovery of FRB 20200120E in association with a globular cluster in the nearby galaxy M81, however, casts doubts on such an assumption. We apply the Monte Carlo method developed in a previous work to test different FRB redshift distribution models against the recently released first CHIME FRB catalog in terms of their distributions in specific fluence, external dispersion measure (\$\textbackslash rm DM\_E\$), and inferred isotropic energy. Our results clearly rule out the hypothesis that all FRBs track the star formation history of the universe. The hypothesis that all FRBs track the accumulated stars throughout history describes the data better but still cannot meet both the \$\textbackslash rm DM\_E\$ and the energy criteria. The data seem to be better modeled with either a redshift distribution model invoking a significant delay with respect to star formation or a hybrid model invoking both a dominant delayed population and a subdominant star formation population. We discuss the implications of this finding for FRB source models.},

However, due to the lack of continuous observations, some apparently repeaters may have been incorrectly recognized as non-repeaters. In a series of two papers, we intend to solve such problem with machine learning. In this second paper of the series, we focus on an array of unsupervised machine learning methods. We apply multiple unsupervised machine learning algorithms to the first CHIME/FRB catalog to learn their features and classify FRBs into different clusters without any premise about the FRBs being repeaters or non-repeaters. These clusters reveal the differences between repeaters and non-repeaters. Then, by comparing with the identities of the FRBs in the observed classes, we evaluate the performance of various algorithms and analyze the physical meaning behind the results. Finally, we recommend a list of most credible repeater candidates as targets for future observing campaigns to search for repeated bursts in combination of the results presented in Paper I using supervised machine learning methods.},
