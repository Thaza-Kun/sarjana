# Introduction

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright (50 mJy – 100 Jy), milliseconds long pulses of radio signal that is extra-terrestrial in nature.
The frequency range of FRBs reported is between  400 MHz to 8 GHz (Petroff et al., 2019).
The underlying process of its emission is still poorly understood.
However, its detection has rapidly increased ever since its identification in Lorimer et al., (2007).
By June 2022, Spanakis-Misirlis, (2021) has reported 806 FRB events including 25 repeaters indexed from the Transient Name Server, the CHIME/FRB Collaboration and several other cited reports.

## Instruments
One reason for the abundance of the detection of FRBs is that many telescope dedicated to FRB has been built within the last decade.
Listed here are several telescopes that have been known to provide open data for FRB transients:

### CHIME/FRB
The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) is a stationary radio telescope located in the southern parts of British Columbia, Canada (49^∘^ 19^'^ 14^''^.52 N,  119^∘^ 37^'^ 25^''^.25 W).
Unlike conventional dish shaped radio telescope, CHIME consists of four 20m x 100m semi-cylindrical reflectors pointed skywards to achieve 8000m2¬ with a sensitivity between 400 to 800 MHz (The CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al., 2018).
This allows the telescope to map ≳200 square degrees of the sky continuously with three different output pipelines: CHIME/Cosmology, CHIME/FRB, and CHIME/Pulsar.
The data relevant to this study is from the CHIME/FRB pipeline.

### Parkes
The Parkes radio telescope is a 64-meter steerable radio telescope located in the central-west region of New South Wales, Australia.
It was the telescope used by Lorimer for the serendipitous discovery of the FRB in 2007.
It has been given the name Murriyang in honour of Australian aboriginals in 2020.
However, the name “Parkes radio telescope” or “Parkes” remains in use within the literature.

## Problem Statement
This proposal aims to answer questions such as:

1. What relationship of its properties can be extracted from the population of known FRBs now that we have more than 800 observed transients?
2. Which FRBs exhibit interesting properties compared to the rest of the population?
3. What might be the reason behind the interesting properties of the FRBs in question (2)?

## Objective
Now that there is an abundant number of FRB detected, and many more are expected to be detected, this proposal aims to:

1. Study the distribution of FRBs to understand the relationship between its properties.
2. Study the properties of selected samples of FRB to gain insight on its source or emission mechanism.
3. Implement programming methods for the distribution study of FRBs and for the feature study of selected FRBs.
