# Introduction

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright (50 mJy â€“ 100 Jy), milliseconds long pulses of radio signal that is extra-terrestrial in nature.
The frequency range of FRBs reported is between  400 MHz to 8 GHz [@petroff_fast_2019].
The underlying process of its emission is still poorly understood.
<!-- However, its detection has rapidly increased ever since its identification in Lorimer et al., (2007).
By June 2022, @spanakis-misirlis_frbstats_2021 has reported 806 FRB events including 25 repeaters indexed from the Transient Name Server, the CHIME/FRB Collaboration and several other cited reports. -->
