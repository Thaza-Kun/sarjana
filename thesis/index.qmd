# Introduction

About 40 years since the discovery of pulsars [@hewish_rapidlyPulsating_1968], @lorimer_bright_2007 found an intriguing burst in the archival data of pulsar surveys collected by the Parkes Telescope.
Pulsars are generally a weak source of radio with flux densities ranging from 0.001 to 5 Jy [@stappers_pulsars_2011]. 
However, this burst is highly energetic with $30\pm 10$ Jy and its distance is inferred to be of extra-galactic origin which leads @lorimer_bright_2007 to conclude it as a new phenomenon.
The burst is informally known as the 'Lorimer Burst'.

Subsequent search for Lorimer Burst-like signal later supported Lorimer's hypothesis especially in @thornton_population_2013 where 4 more bursts with similar properties are reported.
The report prompted more astronomers to discover more Lorimer Burst-like signal whether by combing through archival data or by outright detection in many telescopes around the world.
The name 'fast radio burst' (FRB) were adopted and the Lorimer Burst is now known as FRB 20010724 following the convention FRB YYYYMMDDX [@petroff_fast_2022] where X is an additional identifier should it be necessary.

FRBs are characterized as a radio pulse with durations in the order of milliseconds and a relatively high frequency dispersion (quantified as 'dispersion measure' as will be discussed in @sec-prop-dm). 
As of the end of 2022, the number of FRB known surpasses 800 detections from ~600 unique sources [@spanakis-misirlis_frbstats_2021] as compared to roughly 60 detections in 2019 [@petroff_fast_2019].
@spanakis-misirlis_frbstats_2021 keeps an open source catalog of detected FRBs with their respective citations^[https://herta-experiment.org/frbstats].

For an in-depth review of the growth of FRB research, I would suggest looking into @petroff_fast_2019 and their follow-up review @petroff_fast_2022. 
In contrast, @bailes_discovery_FRB_2022 is a brief but a more personal record as a person working closely with Lorimer during and after the discovery.
This review focuses on the current state of the research and how researchers study the FRB population as a whole.

The origin of FRB is still unknown.
