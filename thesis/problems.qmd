## Problem Statement

It is very apparent that the nature of FRB is currently unknown.
@petroff_fast_2019 counted at least 55 papers on the theories for the progenitor models of FRB, most of which involves a neutron star.
This research does not attempt to add a new progenitor theory into the literature.
However, this theoretical aspect of the study of FRB can benefit from having an understanding in the difference and similarities between known FRBs.

The most obvious difference between FRBs is that some of them repeat but some of them seem to not repeat. 
Some literature have found differences in morphology and distribution discussed later in the same section.
All these differences will be discussed in @sec-classification.

However, these literatures does not address the possibility of a subtype within their respective known types.
This research aims to address that possibility with the assumption that both repeaters and non-repeaters may not have a single origin but multiple origins with overlapping properties making up the 'fast radio burst' phenomena.
These are the questions that this research proposes to answer:

1. Does subsets of repeaters and non-repeaters with specific criteria show statistical significance as opposed to randomly assigning subset labels? 
2. What properties of FRB makes up the differences between subsets?
3. Finally, can these subsets be fitted into existing theories showing that they are indeed multiple phenomena masked as one?
