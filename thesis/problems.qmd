## Problem Statement
This proposal aims to answer questions such as:

1. What relationship of its properties can be extracted from the population of known FRBs now that we have more than 800 observed transients?
2. Which FRBs exhibit interesting properties compared to the rest of the population?
3. What might be the reason behind the interesting properties of the FRBs in question (2)?

## Objective
Now that there is an abundant number of FRB detected, and many more are expected to be detected, this proposal aims to:

1. Study the distribution of FRBs to understand the relationship between its properties.
2. Study the properties of selected samples of FRB to gain insight on its source or emission mechanism.
3. Implement programming methods for the distribution study of FRBs and for the feature study of selected FRBs.
