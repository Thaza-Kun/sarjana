# Conclusion

Current effort to classify FRB other than the obvious difference between repeaters and non-repeaters are very speculative due to the lack of information on FRB.
Most of these efforts are based on the data released by CHIME/FRB.
Data outside of the CHIME/FRB telescope is often neglected due to the difference in robustness between the reported properties. 
If data from other telescopes were to be included in the analysis, considerable efforts will be needed to process those data with the same robustness offered by CHIME/FRB Catalog.
More data is expected in the future, especially from but not limited to CHIME/FRB, and is hoped to reveal some differences between properties and may reveal the nature of these mysterious bursts.
