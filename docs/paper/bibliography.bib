  abstract = {We derive a period determination technique that is well suited to the case of nonsinusoidal time variation covered by only a few irregularly spaced observations. A detailed statistical analysis allows comparison with other techniques and indicates the optimum choice of parameters for a given problem. Application to the double-mode Cepheid BK Cen demonstrates the applicability of these methods to difficult cases. Using 49 photoelectric points, we obtain the two primary oscillatory components as well as the principal mode-interaction term; the derived periods are in agreement with previous estimates.},

  abstract = {The discovery that at least some Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) repeat has ruled out cataclysmic events as the progenitors of these particular bursts. FRB~121102 is the most well-studied repeating FRB but despite extensive monitoring of the source, no underlying pattern in the repetition has previously been identified. Here, we present the results from a radio monitoring campaign of FRB~121102 using the 76\,m Lovell telescope. Using the pulses detected in the Lovell data along with pulses from the literature, we report a detection of periodic behaviour of the source over the span of 5\,yr of data. We predict that the source is currently `off' and that it should turn `on' for the approximate MJD range 59002-59089 (2020 June 2 to 2020 August 28). This result, along with the recent detection of periodicity from another repeating FRB, highlights the need for long-term monitoring of repeating FRBs at a high cadence. Using simulations, we show that one needs at least 100\,h of telescope time to follow-up repeating FRBs at a cadence of 0.5\textendash 3\,d to detect periodicities in the range of 10\textendash 150\,d. If the period is real, it shows that repeating FRBs can have a large range in their activity periods that might be difficult to reconcile with neutron star precession models.},

  abstract = {Detection of a periodic signal hidden in noise is frequently a goal in astronomical data analysis. This paper does not introduce a new detection technique, but instead studies the reliability and efficiency of detection with the most commonly used technique, the periodogram, in the case where the observation times are unevenly spaced. This choice was made because, of the methods in current use, it appears to have the simplest statistical behavior. A modification of the classical definition of the periodogram is necessary in order to retain the simple statistical behavior of the evenly spaced case. With this modification, periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves to the data are exactly equivalent. Certain difficulties with the use of the periodogram are less important than commonly believed in the case of detection of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method for mitigating these difficulties (tapering) can be used just as well if the sampling is uneven. An analysis of the statistical significance of signal detections is presented, with examples},

It is shown that, in the least-squares spectrum of gaussian noise, the reduction in the sum of squares at a particular frequency is aX \{2/2\} variable. The reductions at different frequencies are not independent, as there is a correlation between the height of the spectrum at any two frequencies,f 1 andf 2, which is equal to the mean height of the spectrum due to a sinusoidal signal of frequencyf 1, at the frequencyf 2. These correlations reduce the distortion in the spectrum of a signal affected by noise. Some numerical illustrations of the properties of least-squares frequency spectra are also given.},

  abstract = {We present the discovery of 25 new repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources found among CHIME/FRB events detected between 2019 September 30 and 2021 May 1. The sources were found using a new clustering algorithm that looks for multiple events co-located on the sky having similar dispersion measures (DMs). The new repeaters have DMs ranging from \$\textbackslash sim\$220 pc cm\$\^\{-3\}\$ to \$\textbackslash sim\$1700 pc cm\$\^\{-3\}\$, and include sources having exhibited as few as two bursts to as many as twelve. We report a statistically significant difference in both the DM and extragalactic DM (eDM) distributions between repeating and apparently nonrepeating sources, with repeaters having lower mean DM and eDM, and we discuss the implications. We find no clear bimodality between the repetition rates of repeaters and upper limits on repetition from apparently nonrepeating sources after correcting for sensitivity and exposure effects, although some active repeating sources stand out as anomalous. We measure the repeater fraction over time and find that it tends to an equilibrium of \$2.6\_\{-2.6\}\^\{+2.9\}\$\% over our total time-on-sky thus far. We also report on 14 more sources which are promising repeating FRB candidates and which merit follow-up observations for confirmation.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            We present a catalog of 536 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) Project between 400 and 800 MHz from 2018 July 25 to 2019 July 1, including 62 bursts from 18 previously reported repeating sources. The catalog represents the first large sample, including bursts from repeaters and nonrepeaters, observed in a single survey with uniform selection effects. This facilitates comparative and absolute studies of the FRB population. We show that repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters have sky locations and dispersion measures (DMs) that are consistent with being drawn from the same distribution. However, bursts from repeating sources differ from apparent nonrepeaters in intrinsic temporal width and spectral bandwidth. Through injection of simulated events into our detection pipeline, we perform an absolute calibration of selection effects to account for systematic biases. We find evidence for a population of FRBs\textemdash composing a large fraction of the overall population\textemdash with a scattering time at 600 MHz in excess of 10 ms, of which only a small fraction are observed by CHIME/FRB.
