## What is Fast Radio Bursts?
::::{.columns}
:::{.column}
- Fast Radio Bursts are characterized as a radio signal with short bursts (milliseconds long) and high dispersion measure. 
- It was first identified by @lorimer_bright_2007 in the archival data for pulsar surveys and currently over 800 bursts are detected [@spanakis-misirlis_frbstats_2021].

 <!-- 1 min -->
About 40 years since the discovery of pulsars in 1968, Duncan R. Lorimer found an intriguing burst in the archival data of pulsar surveys collected by the Parkes Telescope. 
Compared to the pulsars which was already extensively studied, this burst is highly energetic and its distance suggested that it is of extra-galactic origin.
Lorimer concluded that it is a different phenomenon and it was informally known as a Lorimer Burst.

Later searches for similar signal came to the same conclusion.
This milliseconds long signal with high dispersion measure is came to be known as 'fast radio bursts' (FRBs).
Currently, there is over 800 detections of this burst with many more expected to be detected.

## CHIME/FRB Catalog
- The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment/Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) telescope releases over 500 bursts [@the_chimefrbcollaboration_FirstCHIMEFRB_2021].

<!-- 30 sec -->
This high number of detections are mainly due to the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope which releases a The CHIME/FRB data catalog of over 600 bursts.
This huge volume of open data prompted many researchers to investigate on the fast radio bursts as a population.

## Repeater vs Non-Repeater
- We only know that some FRB repeat while some do not.
- Is it possible that non-repeaters may repeat someday?
- How do we identify them?

:::{.notes}
<!-- 30 sec -->
There is still a lot to be known about the mysterious nature of fast radio bursts.
However, we know that some bursts do repeat while some of them apparently does not.
Is it possible that these apparently non-repeating fast radio bursts may repeat in the future?
If so, how do we identify them?

## Using Machine Learning{.smaller}

A 2d mapping of 10+ selected features of FRBs using different techniques shows FRBs with similar features clump together.

:::{.notes}
<!-- 30 sec -->
Some studies uses machine learning techniques to help uncover hidden relationships between features of a fast radio bursts such as its 
dispersion measure, peak frequency, brightness temperature et cetera via dimensional reduction.
They found that the features of known repeaters are similar to each other than to most non-repeaters.
Therefore, they hypothesized that non-repeaters that have similar features with the repeaters are potentially repeating while the other may be a true non-repeater.

## Proposal: Possible Subclass?{.smaller}

These 2d mapping shows repeaters clumps together at different points (circled).

:::{.notes}
<!-- Proposal -->
<!-- 10 sec -->
Upon closer inspection, the known repeaters clump together at different positions on this 2d map.
The machine learning results show different groups of repeater FRB.
:::

## Proposal: Possible Subclass?
- Is it possible that there are different types of repeater FRB?
- Can we identify the discerning characteristics of different repeater subclass?
- Can we identify which leading theories fit which subclass?

:::{.notes}
<!-- Proposal -->
<!-- 30 sec -->
I suggest that there might also be a subclassification within known repeaters.
This is what I propose:
- can we reject the hypothesis that the repeater fast radio bursts belong to only one population?
- can we identify the discerning characteristics of different repeater subclass?
- can we identify which leading theories fit which subclass?
