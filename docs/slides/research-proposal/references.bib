	abstract     = {The origins of fast radio bursts (FRBs), astronomical transients with millisecond time-scales, remain unknown. One of the difficulties stems from the possibility that observed FRBs could be heterogeneous in origin; as some of them have been observed to repeat, and others have not. Due to limited observing periods and telescope sensitivities, some bursts may be misclassified as non-repeaters. Therefore, it is important to clearly distinguish FRBs into repeaters and non-repeaters, to better understand their origins. In this work, we classify repeaters and non-repeaters using unsupervised machine learning, without relying on expensive monitoring observations. We present a repeating FRB recognition method based on the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). The main goals of this work are to: (i) show that the unsupervised UMAP can classify repeating FRB population without any prior knowledge about their repetition, (ii) evaluate the assumption that non-repeating FRBs are contaminated by repeating FRBs, and (iii) recognize the FRB repeater candidates without monitoring observations and release a corresponding catalogue. We apply our method to the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) data base. We found that the unsupervised UMAP classification provides a repeating FRB completeness of 95 per cent and identifies 188 FRB repeater source candidates from 474 non-repeater sources. This work paves the way to a new classification of repeaters and non-repeaters based on a single epoch observation of FRBs.},

	abstract     = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are one of the most mysterious astronomical transients. Observationally, they can be classified into repeaters and apparently non-repeaters. However, due to the lack of continuous observations, some apparently repeaters may have been incorrectly recognized as non-repeaters. In a series of two papers, we intend to solve such problem with machine learning. In this second paper of the series, we focus on an array of unsupervised machine learning methods. We apply multiple unsupervised machine learning algorithms to the first CHIME/FRB catalog to learn their features and classify FRBs into different clusters without any premise about the FRBs being repeaters or non-repeaters. These clusters reveal the differences between repeaters and non-repeaters. Then, by comparing with the identities of the FRBs in the observed classes, we evaluate the performance of various algorithms and analyze the physical meaning behind the results. Finally, we recommend a list of most credible repeater candidates as targets for future observing campaigns to search for repeated bursts in combination of the results presented in Paper I using supervised machine learning methods.},

The catalog represents the first large sample, including bursts from repeaters and nonrepeaters, observed in a single survey with uniform selection effects. This facilitates comparative and absolute studies of the FRB population. We show that repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters have sky locations and dispersion measures (DMs) that are consistent with being drawn from the same distribution. However, bursts from repeating sources differ from apparent nonrepeaters in intrinsic temporal width and spectral bandwidth. Through injection of simulated events into our detection pipeline, we perform an absolute calibration of selection effects to account for systematic biases. We find evidence for a population of FRBs\textemdash composing a large fraction of the overall population\textemdash with a scattering time at 600 MHz in excess of 10 ms, of which only a small fraction are observed by CHIME/FRB.
