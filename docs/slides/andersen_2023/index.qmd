# Content
The paper highlights three (3) things:
1. The method used in identifying which two or more signals are repeaters.
2. They found that repeaters tend to have lower DM from apparent non-repeaters.
3. They found that repeater fraction tends to an equilibrium of $2.6^{+2.9}_{-2.6}%$ over time.
