# Research

## Objectives

1. To employ machine learning methods to differentiate known FRBs via their collective properties.
2. To study the statistical differences between properties of FRBs which will thus define characteristics of the respective subclasses.

## Phases
1. Data Exploration
    - [x] To explore available data and methods.
2. Statistical Study
    - [ ] To add new analysis for available data.
3. Extrapolation
    - [ ] To add new data for known methods.
4. Thesis Writing
    - [ ] To summarize research.

# Report

## Phase 1: Data Exploration
### ðŸ“… October 2022
- Read a general overview of the fast radio burst research.
- Read @bohanchen_uncloaking_2021, @luo_machinelearningfrb_2022, @zhuge_machinelearningfrb_2022
- Revise topics on machine learning.
    - Regression
    - Classification
    - Dimensional Reduction
    - Clustering Algorithm

## Phase 1: Data Exploration
### ðŸ“… November 2022
- Fully replicated @bohanchen_uncloaking_2021.

## Phase 1: Data Exploration
### ðŸ“… November 2022
- Collected data relating to repeaters.
- Added a method to score machine learning outcomes.
- Tried to apply @bohanchen_uncloaking_2021's method using FRBSTATS catalog and later found that FRBSTATS catalog does not have enough parameters to bring about significant score.


## Phase 1: Data Exploration
### ðŸ“… December 2022
- Fix bugs in code.
- Begin finding source files of raw data to be used in Phase 3: Extrapolation

## Phase 2: Statistical Study
### ðŸ“… January 2023
- Read papers relating to using statistical methods to find difference between known fast radio bursts.^[@cui_FastRadioBursts_2021, @guo_PossibleSubclassificationFast_2022, @cui_StatisticalPropertiesFast_2021, @arcus_FastRadioBurst_2021]
- Revised topics in statistics.
    - likelihood function and posterior probability
    - point estimation and statistical inference
    - hypothesis testing and distribution comparison

## Phase 2: Statistical Study
### ðŸ“… January 2023
- Writing literature review and proposal
    - Helped narrow down research objectives
    - Helped increase literature

## Phase 2: Statistical Study
### ðŸ“… February 2023
- Downloaded and compressed waterfall data from the CHIME/FRB catalog using a download script.
- Used multi-threading processes to download multiple files simultaneaously
    - Data can be corrupted if multiple processes write to the same file. Learned how to use thread-locking to avoid data corruption 

# Future Plans

## Future
- By the end of March, we should have a result on how FRB's time series data distribution are affected by machine learning classifications.
- By April, we should be able to submit to a publication.
- While waiting for publication, we can work on extending previous method using new data from CHIME/FRB and/or old data from other telescopes for Phase 3: Extrapolation
