  abstract = {We report on the discovery and analysis of bursts from nine new repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources found using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope. These sources span a dispersion measure (DM) range of 195\textendash 1380 pc cm-3. We detect two bursts from three of the new sources, three bursts from four of the new sources, four bursts from one new source, and five bursts from one new source. We determine sky coordinates of all sources with uncertainties of {$\sim$}10{${'}$}. We detect Faraday rotation measures (RMs) for two sources, with values -20(1) and -499.8(7) rad m-2, that are substantially lower than the RM derived from bursts emitted by FRB 121102. We find that the DM distribution of our events, combined with the nine other repeaters discovered by CHIME/FRB, is indistinguishable from that of thus far non-repeating CHIME/FRB events. However, as previously reported, the burst widths appear statistically significantly larger than the thus far non-repeating CHIME/FRB events, further supporting the notion of inherently different emission mechanisms and/or local environments. These results are consistent with previous work, though are now derived from 18 repeating sources discovered by CHIME/FRB during its first year of operation. We identify candidate galaxies that may contain FRB 190303.J1353+48 (DM = 222.4 pc cm-3).},

The catalog consists of 62 bursts from 18 repeating sources, plus 474 one-off FRBs, detected between 2018 July 25 and 2019 July 2. We identify four observed archetypes of burst morphology (``simple broadband,'' ``simple narrowband,'' ``temporally complex,'' and ``downward drifting'') and describe relevant instrumental biases that are essential for interpreting the observed morphologies. Using the catalog properties of the FRBs, we confirm that bursts from repeating sources, on average, have larger widths, and we show, for the first time, that bursts from repeating sources, on average, are narrower in bandwidth. This difference could be due to beaming or propagation effects, or it could be intrinsic to the populations. We discuss potential implications of these morphological differences for using FRBs as astrophysical tools.},

  abstract = {We report the first detections of the repeating fast radio burst source FRB 121102 above 5.2 GHz. Observations were performed using the 4-8 GHz receiver of the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope with the Breakthrough Listen digital backend. We present the spectral, temporal, and polarization properties of 21 bursts detected within the first 60 minutes of a total of 6 hr of observations. These observations comprise the highest burst density yet reported in the literature, with 18 bursts being detected in the first 30 minutes. A few bursts clearly show temporal sub-structure with distinct spectral properties. These sub-structures superimpose to provide an enhanced peak signal-to-noise ratio at higher trial dispersion measures. Broad features occur in {$\sim$}1 GHz wide subbands that typically differ in peak frequency between bursts within the band. Finer-scale structures ({$\sim$}10-50 MHz) within these bursts are consistent with the structure expected from Galactic diffractive interstellar scintillation. The bursts exhibit nearly 100\% linear polarization, and a large average rotation measure of 9.359 {$\pm$} 0.012 \texttimes{} 104 rad m-2 (in the observer's frame). No circular polarization was found for any burst. We measure an approximately constant polarization position angle in the 13 brightest bursts. The peak flux densities of the reported bursts have average values (0.2 {$\pm$} 0.1 Jy) similar to those seen at lower frequencies ({$<$}3 GHz), while the average burst widths (0.64 {$\pm$} 0.46 ms) are relatively narrower.},

  abstract = {FRB 121102 is the only known repeating fast radio burst source. Here we analyze a wide-frequency-range (1-8 GHz) sample of high signal-to-noise, coherently dedispersed bursts detected using the Arecibo and Green Bank telescopes. These bursts reveal complex time-frequency structures that include subbursts with finite bandwidths. The frequency-dependent burst structure complicates the determination of a dispersion measure (DM); we argue that it is appropriate to use a DM metric that maximizes frequency-averaged pulse structure, as opposed to peak signal-to-noise, and find DM = 560.57 {$\pm$} 0.07 pc cm-3 at MJD 57,644. After correcting for dispersive delay, we find that the subbursts have characteristic frequencies that typically drift lower at later times in the total burst envelope. In the 1.1-1.7 GHz band, the {$\sim$}0.5-1 ms subbursts have typical bandwidths ranging from 100 to 400 MHz, and a characteristic drift rate of {$\sim$}200 MHz ms-1 toward lower frequencies. At higher radio frequencies, the subburst bandwidths and drift rate are larger, on average. While these features could be intrinsic to the burst emission mechanism, they could also be imparted by propagation effects in the medium local to the source. Comparison of the burst DMs with previous values in the literature suggests an increase of {$\Delta$}DM {$\sim$} 1-3 pc cm-3 in 4 yr; though, this could be a stochastic variation as opposed to a secular trend. This implies changes in the local medium or an additional source of frequency-dependent delay. Overall, the results are consistent with previously proposed scenarios in which FRB 121102 is embedded in a dense nebula.},

  abstract = {We report a new fast radio burst (FRB) discovered in real-time as part of the UTMOST project at the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Radio Telescope. FRB170827 was first detected with our low-latency ({$<$}24 s) and machine-learning based FRB detection system. The FRB discovery was accompanied by the capture of voltage data at the native time and frequency resolution of the observing system, enabling coherent dedispersion and detailed off-line analysis that have unveiled fine temporal and frequency structure. The dispersion measure (DM) of 176.80 {$\pm$} 0.04 pc cm-3 is the lowest of the FRB population. The Milky Way contribution along the line of sight is {$\sim$}40 pc cm-3, leaving an excess DM of {$\sim$}145 pc cm-3. The FRB has a fluence {$>$}20 {$\pm$} 7 Jy ms, and is narrow with a width of {$\sim$}400 \{{$\mu\rbrace$}s at 10 per cent of its maximum amplitude. However, the burst shows three temporal components, the narrowest of which is {$\sim$}30 \{{$\mu\rbrace$}s, and a scattering time-scale of 4.1 {$\pm$} 2.7 \{{$\mu\rbrace$}s. The FRB shows spectral modulations on frequency scales of 1.5 MHz and 0.1 MHz. Both are prominent in the dynamic spectrum, which shows a very bright region of emission between 841 and 843 MHz, and weaker and patchy emission across the entire band. We show that the fine spectral structure could arise in the FRB host galaxy, or its immediate vicinity.\vphantom{\}\}\}}},
