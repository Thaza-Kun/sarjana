Here, we describe the new columns added by this work (see also The CHIME/FRB Collaboration 2021, for other column names).

 - subw_upper_flag: width_fitb and logsubw_int_rest indicate upper limits if 1. Otherwise 0. Different for sub-bursts.
 - scat_upper_flag: scat_time indicates the upper limit if 1. Otherwise 0. Common for sub-bursts with the same tns_name.
 - spec_z: spectroscopic redshift if available. Otherwise −9999. Common for sub-bursts with the same tns_name.
 - spec_z_flag: spec_z is available if 1. Otherwise 0. Common for sub-bursts with the same tns_name.
 - E_obs (Jy ms Hz): fluence (Jy ms) × Δν, where Δν is the band width of 400 MHz at observer’s frame. Common for sub-bursts with the same tns_name.
 - E_obs_error (Jy ms Hz): error of E_obs. Common for sub-bursts with the same tns_name.
 - subb_flag: 1 if the row belongs to multiple sub-bursts. 0 means FRBs without sub-bursts. Common for sub-bursts with the same tns_name.
 - subb_p_flag: subb_p_flag=1 can be used when sub-burst parameters are used. All rows have 1.
 - common_p_flag: common_p_flag=1 can be used when common parameters are used. For each tns_name, the first sub-burst indicates 1. Different for sub-bursts.
 - delta_nuo_FRB: (MHz) observed spectral band width. Common for sub-bursts. i.e. high_freq−low_freq for FRBs without multiple sub-bursts and max(high_freq)−min(low_freq) for FRBs with multiple sub-bursts. The latter works because there is no frequency gap between sub-bursts in the catalogue.
