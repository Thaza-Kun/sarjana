tns_name,"Name ID provided for each burst. The same repeating FRB source has multiple tns_name due to its repetition.  A non-repeating FRB has the single tns_name. The same tns_name can have multiple sub-bursts.  Therefore, multiple rows with the same tns_name is due to the sub-bursts."
classification,"FRB classification provides by machine learning model.  1 = repeating FRB, 0 = repeating FRB candidate and -1 = non-repeating FRB"
group,"The clustering result for machine learning model output.  See Fig.3 of the paper." 
embedding_x,"The x coordinate of the low dimensional projection of each FRB.  See Fig.2, 3, 4 of the paper."
embedding_y,"The y coordinate of the low dimensional projection of each FRB.  See Fig.2, 3, 4 of the paper."
