# Master Project
This repository is meant to document my Master's work under Dr Noriah Hashim and Dr Zambri Zainal in University Malaya.

## Problem Statements

These problem statements are taken from the proposal and will likely change and become more specific in the future:

1.  What relationship of its properties can be extracted from the population of known FRBs now that we have more than 800 observed transients?
2.  Which FRBs exhibit interesting properties compared to the rest of the population?
3.  What might be the reason behind the interesting properties of the FRBs in question (2)?
