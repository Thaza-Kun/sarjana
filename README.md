# Masters Project
This repository is meant to document my Masters in Physics' work under Dr Noriah Hashim and Dr Zamri Zainal in University Malaya.

## Problem Statements

These problem statements are as follows:

1.  Can we use machine learning techniques to help classify Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)?
2.  If machine learning algorithms uncover more than a binary classification of repeating and non-repeating FRBs, is it possible that they are sampled from different origins?
3.  If so, what are the important features that differentiate between subclasses?

## Requirements
- The `cfod` package used to access the CHIME/FRB catalog requires Linux or WSL.
- The `fruitbat` package used to calculate redshift requires Linux or WSL.
