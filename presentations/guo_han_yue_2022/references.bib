  abstract = {The redshift distribution of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is not well constrained. The association of the Galactic FRB 200428 with the young magnetar SGR 1935+2154 raises the working hypothesis that FRB sources track the star formation history of the universe. The discovery of FRB 20200120E in association with a globular cluster in the nearby galaxy M81, however, casts doubts on such an assumption. We apply the Monte Carlo method developed in a previous work to test different FRB redshift distribution models against the recently released first CHIME FRB catalog in terms of their distributions in specific fluence, external dispersion measure (\$\textbackslash rm DM\_E\$), and inferred isotropic energy. Our results clearly rule out the hypothesis that all FRBs track the star formation history of the universe. The hypothesis that all FRBs track the accumulated stars throughout history describes the data better but still cannot meet both the \$\textbackslash rm DM\_E\$ and the energy criteria. The data seem to be better modeled with either a redshift distribution model invoking a significant delay with respect to star formation or a hybrid model invoking both a dominant delayed population and a subdominant star formation population. We discuss the implications of this finding for FRB source models.},

  abstract = {Currently, fast radio bursts (FRBs) have become a very active field in astronomy and cosmology. However, the origin of FRBs is still unknown to date. The studies on the intrinsic FRB distributions might help us to reveal the possible origins of FRBs, and improve the simulations for FRB cosmology. Recently, the first CHIME/FRB catalog of 536 events was released. Such a large uniform sample of FRBs detected by a single telescope is very valuable to test the FRB distributions. Later, it has been claimed that the FRB distribution model tracking the cosmic star formation history (SFH) was rejected by the first CHIME/FRB catalog. In the present work, we consider some empirical FRB distribution models, and find that many of them can be fully consistent with the CHIME/FRB observational data for some suitable model parameters. Notice that a suppressed evolution with respect to SFH is commonly found for FRBs. In particular, we independently confirm that the FRB distribution model tracking SFH can be rejected at very high confidence. On the other hand, all the ``successful'' models effectively require a certain degree of ``delay'' with respect to SFH. These results might shed light on the origin of FRBs and FRB cosmology.},
