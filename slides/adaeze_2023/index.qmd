## Data Source
- Detected between 30 Sept 2019 - 01 May 2021.
- Dispersion Measure (DM) ranging from ~220 to ~1700 pc cm^-3^
- Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) > 8.5
- Frequency between 400 MHz - 800 MHz

## Method: Identifying Repeaters

1. Clustering Algorithm
2. Contamination Rate

## Method: Identifying Repeaters
### Clustering Algorithm

- Sources with similar RA, DEC, and DM likely come from the same source.
- They used DBSCAN^[Density--Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, @ester_DensityBasedAlgorithmDiscovering_1996] to identify points with similar values in the three measures mentioned.

## 
### Clustering Algorithm

- DBSCAN is a clustering algorithm whose number of clusters are entirely based on the shape of the data.

## Method: Identifying Repeaters
### Contamination Rate

- For each cluster, they calculate the probability of detecting additional $x-1$ coincident bursts that are physically unrelated.
- This probability of a coincident burst is a binomial distribution (either coincident, or non-coincident).
- The contamination rate, $R_{cc}$, is then equals to this probability multiplied by the number of total detections, $N=2197$.

### Contamination Rate

##
### Contamination Rate

- "Gold" sample (32 sources): A source with $R_{cc} < 0.5$ is deemed as a real repeating sources of FRBs, such that there is less than 50% probability that one source in the sample got included by chance.
- "Silver" sample (18 sources): A source with $0.5 \leq R_{cc} < 5$ is a candidate repeater and warrants follow up observation.
- [Excluding those with inconsistent localizations]{.mark}, we arrive at 25 gold samples and 14 silver samples.

## Analysis

- Most repeater bursts show narrow bandwidths of typically 50â€“200 MHz.
- Some sources showing bursts with clear cases of downward--drifting subbursts, consistent with @pleunis_FastRadioBurst_2021.
- Repeaters have consistently lower DM compared to non-repeaters.
- Repeater show no significant difference in flux.

## Repeater Fraction

- By dividing the sky into 6 declination bins, they found that the repeater fraction tends to an equilibrium of 2.6%.

## Conclusion

1. A combination of clustering algorithm and contamination rate calculation found 25 new repeaters and 14 candidate repeaters.
2. Repeaters have consistently lower DM from non-repeaters.
3. Repeater fraction tends to an equilibrium of $2.6^{+2.9}_{-2.6}\%$ over time.
